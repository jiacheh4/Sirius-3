## Summary

In this project, our goal is to train an agent to protect villagers and eliminate zombies using deep reinforcement learningâ€”a technique that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. Initially, the agent explores the environment by randomly selecting actions, but over time, it learns from its experiences and begins to choose the most effective moves to achieve its objectives.
